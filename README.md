# JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience

This repository contains the completed tasks from the **JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Internship** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). The original project structure and base code were provided by J.P. Morgan as part of the simulation. I **did not build the entire project from scratch** â€” I forked the official repo and completed the assigned tasks as instructed.
